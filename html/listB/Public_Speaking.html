    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 1: Understanding speech</h3>
      <p>Thank you for joining Introduction to Public Speaking! I am thrilled at the prospect of a global discussion
        about good speech. Let's get started! In this module, we’ll focus on the basics of the course and how rhetorical
        canons will help us structure our time. Then we’ll turn to the important ways that speaking and writing differ.
        By the end of this week, you should have some tools for evaluating your speech writing. If you want some
        feedback, you’ll be able to upload an introductory speech for peer review.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 2: Making ideas compelling and memorable</h3>
      <p>Now that we have the course foundation out of the way, we can work on our basic speech model: the key point
        speech. I love this format. It's the Swiss army knife of speeches. This basic model works in interviews, short
        presentations, elevator talks, and can even structure an hour long presentation. After overviewing the
        assignment, we’ll talk about how to plan out your speeches. By the end of the week, you should have some tools
        for quickly putting together short presentations. You can practice this by analyzing some speeches.

      <h3>Week 3: Illustrating and delivering your ideas</h3>
      <p>This week, we’ll talk about support and arrangement. The lessons here will immediately help all of your other
        presentations. Why? Because we need to think about how audiences hear our ideas in real time. There are things
        we should be doing to help listeners instantly organize and process the information we’re presenting to them. By
        the end of the week, you should be able to discuss evidence clearly and highlight your speech's organization. If
        you want some feedback, you’ll be able to upload a practice elevator speech for peer review.
      </p>

      <h3>Week 4: Overcoming your fear of public speaking and developing great delivery</h3>
      <p>This week, we'll discuss speech apprehension and delivery. I know the fear of public speaking is a pressing
        topic for many. Why didn’t we start the course with this? Because I think many delivery concerns go away if the
        invention and arrangement are good. However, invention and arrangement are just part of the equation - now we
        can supercharge our delivery. By the end of this week, you’ll have some techniques for combating those
        butterflies and speaking confidently. If you want some feedback, you’ll be able to upload a practice key point
        speech for peer review.

      <h3>Week 5: Course conclusion and your final speech</h3>
      <p>Thank you for time in this course. I hope the material has proven helpful in some way. We concluded our
        discussion of the speech last week. I would like to spend a bit of time reflecting on the course and talking a
        bit about the other courses in this specialization. We will end this week with your final key point speech.
