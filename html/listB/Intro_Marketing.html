      <h3>Week 4: BRANDING: Effective Brand Communications Strategies and Repositioning Strategies</h3>
      <p>Professor Kahn is back in this fourth module, the second of her Branding Modules, covering effective brand
        communications strategies and repositioning strategies. Understanding how customers perceive your brand
        messaging and marketing is one of the most important aspects to understanding consumer behavior: what consumers
        perceive is what affects their actions, and what they perceive is not necessarily true! Professor Kahn unpacks
        customer behavior and perception and explores successful strategies for influencing both in this final required
        module of the course.

        lectures may deepen your understanding of course concepts, but won't be tested directly on the quizzes or exam.
