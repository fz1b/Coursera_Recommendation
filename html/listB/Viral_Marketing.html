        diverge or do something different. At the end of this module, you'll understand how to avoid being influenced by

      <h3>Week 4: Social Networks</h3>
      <p>In this module, you'll learn what social networks are, and how they shape the spread of information and
        influence. How the patterns of social ties between people determine what we do, and what catches on. How people
        we’ve never even met can influence our tastes and preferences. You’ll learn about how strong and weak ties help
        get people jobs, and whether to concentrate or spread out marketing resources when launching a new product. By
