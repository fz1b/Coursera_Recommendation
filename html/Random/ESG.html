      Thatâ€™s why in 2015 the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This agenda includes 17
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that target the big challenges such as how to eliminate poverty, how to
      protect the environment and how to bring about peace. Every member state committed to achieving these goals by
      2030.
