        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">

        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            You will find this course exciting and rewarding if you already have a background in statistics, can use R
            or another programming language and are familiar with databases and data analysis techniques such as
            regression, classification, and clustering.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">

        <div class="paragraph">
            Business Analytics, Big Data and Data Science are very hot topics today, and for good reasons. Companies are
            sitting on a treasure trove of data, but usually lack the skills and people to analyze and exploit that data
            efficiently. Those companies who develop the skills and hire the right people to analyze and exploit that
            data will have a clear competitive advantage.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            It's especially true in one domain: marketing. About 90% of the data collected by companies today are
            related to customer actions and marketing activities.The domain of Marketing Analytics is absolutely huge,
            and may cover fancy topics such as text mining, social network analysis, sentiment analysis, real-time
            bidding, online
            campaign optimization, and so on.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            But at the heart of marketing lie a few basic questions that often remain unanswered:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    who are my customers
                </li>
                <li>
                    which customers should I target and spend most of my marketing budget on
                </li>
                <li>
                    what's the future value of my customers so I can concentrate on those who will be worth the most
                    to the company in the future.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <div class="paragraph">
                That's exactly what this course will cover: segmentation is all about understanding your customers,
                scorings models are about targeting the right ones, and customer lifetime value is about
                anticipating their future value. These are the foundations of Marketing Analytics. And that's what
                you'll learn to do in this course.
