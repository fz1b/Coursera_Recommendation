            In this course, the second in the Market Research Specialization, you will go in-depth with qualitative
            market research methods, from design to implementation to analysis.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Week 1: Define qualitative research and how it differs from quantitative research. Explore the various
            qualitative research methods and evaluate when and how to use them for your research project.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Week 2: Design the qualitative instruments necessary for your interviews or focus groups, and plan your
            recruitment efforts. Write questions and prompts to ask in an interview or focus group. Design a moderator
            guide and a screening questionnaire to use when recruiting your participants.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Week 3: Recruit participants for your focus group and apply techniques to ensure they show up and
            participate. Act as a moderator during your focus group and apply strategies to handle various types of
            situations. Probe responses and engage participants in a group discussion, while collecting qualitative data
            and keep the discussion moving.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            Week 4: Organize and analyze the data you have collected. Transcribe the audio from your focus group or
            interview and interpret your notes. Write a focus group report that can be presented to your stakeholders
            and see how this information might relate to your quantitative research.
