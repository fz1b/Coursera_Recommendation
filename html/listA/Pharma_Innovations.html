            This course in the Healthcare Marketplace specialization gives the learner an in-depth view of the
            intellectual property creation that is vital to creating breakthrough technologies. Included is an
            understanding of the strategy deployed for pricing drugs and new technologies as well as the market sizing
            exercise to identify where future research and development investments should be made.

            <h3>The Pharmaceutical Industry: Bench Science to Bedside</h3>
            <p>In this module you will learn how medical technology goes from ideas to treatments. First we will focus
                on the pharmaceutical industry. The take-away messages from this module are that there are many exciting
                ideas that never make it out of the lab. Furthermore, those ideas that do make it out requires hundreds
                of millions of dollars per innovation. The skills gained from this module to enable a successful
                capstone is an appreciation of how technologies are innovated a midst a sea of regulation and
                intellectual property constraints. You will be better prepared to under the features of likely
                successful drug before it goes to market and competes to enhance and save lives.

            <h3>Pharmaceutical Market Deployment & Management</h3>
            <p>In this module you will learn about how the pharmaceutical industry takes a product that has cleared the
                bench and sells it in the market. Pharmaceutical marketing of a drug product is one of the most complex
                consumer behavior activities in practice today. Selling a new drug in a highly competitive global market
                space with a patent clock ticking is a constant tactical game played out on a long strategic clock that
                also runs into subsequent generic deployment. The take-away messages from this module are the
                pharmaceutical market requires strategic thinking that considers an array of contingencies. The market
                also must be nimble to adjust to different government policies that can create or break decades long
                product lines and therapeutic interventions. The skills gained from this module are an understanding of
                the competitive landscape analysis as well as threat assessment analysis required to complete the
                capstone medical innovation project.

            <h3>The Medical Device Industry: Bench Science to Bedside</h3>
            <p>In this module you will learn how medical device industry innovates and brings transformational products
                to market. The take-away messages from this module are that there are many exciting ideas that never
                make it off the cutting room floor of universities and research labs. Furthermore, those devices that do
                make it have to quite novel to compete in an increasingly crowded space. The skills gained from this
                module to enable a successful capstone is an appreciation of how medical devices are innovated a midst a
                sea of regulation and intellectual property constraints. You will be better prepared to under the
                features of likely successful medical device before it goes to market and competes to enhance and save
                lives.

            <h3>Medical Device Market Deployment & Management</h3>
            <p>In this module you will learn about how the medical device industry takes a product that has cleared the
                bench and sells it in the market. Selling a new medical device in a highly competitive global market
                space with a patent clock ticking is a constant tactical game particularly in the crowed medical device
                Class 1 and Class 2 space. The take-away messages from this module are the medical device market
                requires constant innovation with product updates required at a far quicker rate than the pharmaceutical
                market. Manufacturers must also be nimble to adjust to different government reimbursement policies that
                put great financial risk or previously risk free core customers. The skills gained from this module are
                an understanding of the competitive landscape analysis as well as threat assessment analysis required to
                complete the capstone medical innovation project.
