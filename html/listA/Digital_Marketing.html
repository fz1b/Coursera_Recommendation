  <h1>Digital Marketing Capstone</h1>
  <div class="pagebody">
    <div class="paragraph">
      This capstone course is designed to give you hands-on experience in executing a digital marketing campaign for a
      fictitious firm selling electronics. In the previous courses on analytics and channels, you came up with
      strategies to identify a firmâ€™s objectives, specify a few key ones, research alternatives to reaching the customer
      in their decision journey and finally propose a multi-channel digital marketing plan. In this capstone, you will
      execute a campaign, rather than creating another "plan".
