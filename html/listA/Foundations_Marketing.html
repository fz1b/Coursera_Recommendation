            This course is designed for students, business analysts, and data scientists who want to apply statistical
            knowledge and techniques to business contexts. For example, it may be suited to experienced statisticians,
            analysts, engineers who want to move more into a business role, in particular in marketing.

            <h3>Week 1 : Introduction to Foundation of Marketing Analytics</h3>
            <p>In this short module, we will introduce the field of marketing analytics, and layout the structure of
                this course. We will also take that opportunity to explore a retailing data set that we’ll be using
                throughout this course. We will setup the environment, load the data in R (we’ll be using the RStudio
                environment), and explore it using simple SQL statements.
            </p>

            <h3>Week 2 : Statistical segmentation</h3>
            <p>In this module, you will learn the inner workings of statistical segmentation, how to compute statistical
                indicators about customers such as recency or frequency, and how to identify homogeneous groups of
                customers within a database. We will alternate lectures and R tutorials, making sure that, by the end of
                this module, you will be able to apply every concept we will cover.

            <h3>Week 3 : Managerial segmentation</h3>
            <p>Statistical segmentation is an invaluable tool, especially to explore, summarize, or make a snapshot of
                an existing database of customers. But what most academics will fail to tell you is that this kind of
                segmentation is not the method of choice for many companies, and for good reasons. In this module, you
                will learn to perform managerial segmentations, which are not built upon statistical techniques, but are
                an essential addition to your toolbox of marketing analyst. You will also learn how to segment a
                database now, but also at any point in time in the past, and why it is useful to managers to do so.

            <h3>Week 4 : Targeting and scoring models</h3>
            <p>How can Target predict which of its customers are pregnant? How can a bank predict the likelihood you
                will default on their loan, or crash your car within the next five years, and price accordingly? And if
                your firm only has the budget to reach a few customers during a marketing campaign, who should it target
                to maximize profit? The answer to all these questions is… by building a scoring model, and targeting
                your customers accordingly. In this module, you will learn how to build a customer score, which in
                marketing usually combines two predictions in one : what is the likelihood that a customer will buy
                something, and if he does, how much will he buy for?

            <h3>Week 5 : Customer lifetime value</h3>
            <p>In this module, you will learn how to use R to execute lifetime value analyses. You will learn to
                estimate what is called a transition matrix -which measures how customers transition from one segment to
                another- and use that information to make invaluable predictions about how a customer database is likely
                to evolve over the next few years, and how much money it should be worth.
