  <h1>Driving business towards the Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
  <div class="pagebody">
    <div class="paragraph">
      Extreme weather events, wars, famine and environmental destruction are just a few of the wicked problems faced by
      humanity.
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      That’s why in 2015 the United Nations adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This agenda includes 17
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that target the big challenges such as how to eliminate poverty, how to
      protect the environment and how to bring about peace. Every member state committed to achieving these goals by
      2030.

      <h3>Week 2: The Biosphere</h3>
      <p>This week focuses on the SDGs that are most related to our planet and the biosphere. We will explore what
        companies can do to halt, reverse or mitigate climate change, and protect life on land and below water.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 3: Society I</h3>
      <p>This week is the first of two weeks dedicated to those SDGs that relate to Society. We introduce societal
        challenges such as hunger and poverty, and we look at new business models for healthcare and the transition to
        sustainable energy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 4: Society II</h3>
      <p>This week is about the remaining SDGs related to society. We look at cities, education, and tackling
        inequality. We examine sustainable city transportation networks and how social entrepreneurship can support
        education that promotes employment for everyone. We also talk about the interconnectedness of the SDGs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 5: Economy</h3>
      <p>In this week, we will explore the SDGs related to the economy. We will explore business contribution to SDGs 8,
        9 and 12 and find out why decent work conditions, innovation and infrastructure, and sustainable consumption and
        production are so important. The key question is how businesses can be (both socially as well as economically)
        profitable in the long run while respecting planetary boundaries and human rights.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 6: Partnerships</h3>
      <p>The SDGs cannot be achieved by a single individual or organization. In this module we will explore how
        companies, governments, non-profit organizations and individuals can develop partnerships to achieve peace and
        prosperity for all.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <h3>Week 7: Systems thinking</h3>
      <p>The last week of this MOOC will focus on the interconnectedness of the SDGs. None of the SDGs can be achieved
        by themselves or in isolation. This week, we will explore how the SDGs are interconnected and how synergies and
        trade-offs work.
