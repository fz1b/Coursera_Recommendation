    <h1>Strategy Formulation</h1>
    <div class="pagebody">
        <div class="paragraph">
            The purpose of this course is to present, analyze and discuss the different facets of business strategy
            formulation. Emphasizing that strategy can be seen as a unified theme that provides coherence and direction
            to the actions and decisions of a firm, we will cover a variety of business strategy topics concerned with
            firm positioning in the context of different markets, industries and locations.

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>Introducing strategy formulation</h3>
            <p>In the first module of this course, we will examine and discuss the foundations of strategy formulation,
                emphasizing key concepts such as competitive advantage, value creation, planned vs emerging strategy,
                and strategic fit.

            <h3>Industry analysis</h3>
            <p>Building on the insights generated in the first session, in the second module we explore different
                industrial organization frameworks and discuss the importance of industry effects on firm performance.
                Keywords of this module include competition, industry attractiveness, and the ‘Five forces’-framework.

            <h3>Resources and capabilities</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this session is to understand the role of firm resources and capabilities in building and
                formulating a strong strategy. In particular, we will discuss concepts such as the value chain, core
                capabilities, heterogeneous resources, and the VRIO framework.

            <h3>Global strategies and the multinational corporation</h3>
            <p>The opportunities and challenges of operating internationally are substantially different to the domestic
                context. Thus, to understand strategy in a global context, we focus on the multinational corporation and
                discuss strategic terms like foreign entry mode, location strategies, global integration/local
                adaptation, and distance.
            </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <h3>Strategic decision making</h3>
            <p>In this module, we will investigate the processes of strategic decision making and explore how this
                matters for firm performance. We will discuss topics such as ‘bounded rationality’, management politics,
                and hidden costs.
