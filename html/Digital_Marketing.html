      This capstone course is designed to give you hands-on experience in executing a digital marketing campaign for a
      fictitious firm selling electronics. In the previous courses on analytics and channels, you came up with
      strategies to identify a firmâ€™s objectives, specify a few key ones, research alternatives to reaching the customer
      in their decision journey and finally propose a multi-channel digital marketing plan. In this capstone, you will
      execute a campaign, rather than creating another "plan".

      You will use an online simulation to do this. You will be a marketing manager for a firm selling digital cameras
      online through their webstore. You will be reviewing the products, pricing, margins, and historical sales. You
      will create a targeted ad campaign after researching appropriate keywords for the products you are selling. You
      will also review the basics of landing page design and search engine optimization. You will then create and
      execute an email campaign. Once these campaigns are executed, you get feedback on the KPI's such as revenue,
      profits, traffic, conversions. You will get an opportunity to redo this campaign, with new strategies, to improve
      your KPI's in the second round.
